This project may not work with the latest Bukkit version (or at all) and may not receive any further updates by myself however, feel free to fork this and make improvements. I'll certainly consider any pull requests made and will try to assist with any issues.

#PunchCard

What it does:
- Allows your staff to be (mostly) regular players with only a single additional permission which grants them the ability to "clock in" to perform mod/admin duties
- Doesn't mess with inventory
- Saves the players last position and restores that once they "clock out"
